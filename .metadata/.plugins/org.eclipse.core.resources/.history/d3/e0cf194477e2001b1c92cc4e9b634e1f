TEST NG :

It is a java testing framework .The goal of testng is to cover wide range of test categories

Testcases can be executed with the help of testng instead of running every java class using main method

TESTNG xml file :
It is a configuration file that is used to organize test 
It makes a tester's job easier by controlling the execution of tests by putting all the test cases together and run it under one XML file.

PRIORATIZING TESTCASES :

SUITE NAME -> TEST NAME -> CLASS NAME

XML hierarchy :
Test suite -> Test folder -> Test cases


There can be multiple suites inside an xml file 

1)INCLUDE AND EXCLUDE MECHANISM :

It is a process of including or excluding the methods present inside the class on our needs
Using this we can get a control on running specific methods inside the classes

If we are running some 100 regression test cases then we can remove the unwanted test cases using this mechanism

To EXCLUDE a particular method just give the below syntax

Test -> classes -> class-> methods -> exclude.

   
To INCLUDE only a particular method just give the below syntax
   
Test -> classes -> methods-> include.


2)Executing the testcases at the package level with regex.
In Automation frameworks naming conventions are important and must be followed we should give a common name at starting to all methods depending on the module

SCENARIO :
If there are three functionalities are there but we want to run only selected testcases then

Inside the methods name tag just give a dot followed by * methodstartingname


3)Executing all the testcases inside the package

Create a new testng xml file:
Packages -> package name 



4)TestNG annotations:

@Beforesuite : @BS annotated method will run before the execution of
